** YubiKey Firmware
The firmware of a YubiKey can not be changed (it's read-only). This means that when new features become available, you would need to purchase that latest version of YubiKey. Also be aware of the firmware version when purchasing.

| Firmware  | FIDO2 | FIDO U2F  | PIV | OATH-TOTP | OTP                               | OPENPGP           |
| 5.7       |   100 | unlimited |   4 |        64 | 2 credentials, unlimited services | 3 subkeys [S E A] |
| 5.0 - 5.6 |    25 | unlimited |   4 |        32 | 2 credentials, unlimited services | 3 subkeys [S E A] |

There are many different YubIkey types and versions available. Check the [[https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002541740-Devices][YubiKey devices]] webpage for further specifications.

** YubiKey 5 Pincodes
The YubiKey 5 offers several security applications. Each application is managed individually, and therefor multiple PIN codes needs to be set. In total, the YubiKey 5 has 5 PIN codes, 1 PUK admin code, and 1 Reset code.

* Prerequisites
** Software Installation
Install the ~yubikey-manager~ software:
#+begin_src shell
  sudo pacman -S yubikey-manager
  sudo systemctl enable pcscd.service
  sudo systemctl start pcscd.service
#+end_src

** YubiKey hardware
Withe the software installed, plug in the ~YubiKey~ and check the type and firmware to understand the capabilities:

#+begin_src shell
  ykman info
  # Device type: YubiKey 5 NFC
  # Serial number: XXXXXXXX
  # Firmware version: 5.4.3
  # Form factor: Keychain (USB-A)
  # Enabled USB interfaces: OTP, FIDO, CCID
  # NFC transport is enabled

  # Applications        USB         NFC
  # Yubico OTP          Enabled     Enabled
  # FIDO U2F            Enabled     Enabled
  # FIDO2               Enabled     Enabled
  # OATH                Enabled     Enabled
  # PIV                 Enabled     Enabled
  # OpenPGP             Enabled     Enabled
  # YubiHSM Auth        Enabled     Enabled
#+end_src

* Configuration
A YubiKey has different applications (modes) that can be enabled / disabled / configured and reset individually.
The ~yubikey-manager~ python library is used to configure all aspects of the YubiKey. It contains sections to configure the application:

| info    | show general information                              |
| list    | list connected YubiKeys                               |
| script  | run a python script                                   |
| config  | configure the YubiKey, enable or disable applications |
| fido    | manage the FIDO applications                          |
| hsmauth | manage the YubiHSM Auth application                   |
| oath    | manage the OATH application                           |
| openpgp | manage the OpenPGP application                        |
| otp     | manage the YubiOTP application                        |
| piv     | manage the PIV application                            |

The following notes provide sample scripts to configure a ~5-Series YubiKey~.
** Master Lock Code
There is one PIN that rules them all. The YubiKey has a master ~config~ application that allows enabling or disabling each individual application on the YubiKey. When an application is disabled, its configuration and secrets cannot be accessed or changed — or wiped. This is particularly important to take note of, since otherwise wiping an application's config and secrets (aka a “factory reset”) does not require the application's own PIN or passphrase.

The YubiKey provides a 128-bit ~lock code~ to protect changes to this master config app. By default, YubiKey comes with no lock code set. However, in order to prevent an adversary who gains access to a computer while a YubiKey is plugged in from being able to lock you out of all your YubiKey secrets, a master ~lock code~ should be set.

The ~lock-code~ is a string of 32 hex digits. Run the following command to set the lock code for the YubiKey to a new random number:

#+begin_src shell
  ykman config set-lock-code --generate
  # Using a randomly generated lock code: dac67aece839402edca8272528e837a6
  # Lock configuration with this lock code? [y/N]:
  y
#+end_src

The ~lock-code~ is required every time an application is enabled / disabled.

** Reseting YubiKey
It is not possible to ~factory reset~ the entire YubiKey with a single command.
Instead each application provides an individual reset function, that only wipes the setting / keys / etc of that application. You require the application's ~admin PIN~  to reset the application.

#+begin_src shell
  ykman -f openpgp reset      # wipes all OpenPGP data, and sets all PINs to their default values
  ykman -f fido reset         # wipes all FIDO, FIDO U2F credentials and removes the PIN code
  ykman -f oath reset         # wipes all accounts and restores factory settings
  ykman -f piv reset          # wipes all data and restores factory settings for the PIV application
#+end_src

** Configure YubiKey for OpenPGP
*** Enable OpenPGP Mode
The enable OpenPGP mode on ~YubiKey~ execute the following commands:

#+begin_src shell
  ykman config usb -f -e OPENPGP
#+end_src

*** Enable Key Derived Function (KDF)
Key Derived Function enables YubiKey to store the hash of a PIN rather than the PIN itself, preventing the PIN to be transfered in plan text.

NOTE: KDF must be enabled BEFORE changing the PINs or moving sub-keys to YubiKey.

#+begin_src shell
  gpg --card-edit
  gpg/card> admin
  # Admin commands are allowed
  gpg/card> kdf-setup
  # Enabling KDF ensures PIN is not stored on the YubiKey, only its hash. It needs to be done before changing PIN. More.
#+end_src

*** Configure PIN codes
The OpenPGP app has 3 PINs:
1. User PIN,
2. Reset PIN (aka PUK, PIN Unblock Key),
3. Admin PIN.
The user PIN is used for day-to-day access to OpenPGP private keys.
The reset PIN is not necessary as it can be controlled by the admin PIN.
The admin PIN is used to change the settings of the OpenPGP app itself (and to unblock or change the user PIN if is forgotten or entered incorrectly too many times).
When prompted to enter a “PIN” with no “admin” qualifier, this usually means to enter the user PIN, not the admin PIN.

#+begin_src shell
  gpg --edit-card
  gpg/card> admin
  gpg/card> passwd
  # gpg: OpenPGP card no. ABCDE123456789000006123456780000 detected
  # 1 - change PIN
  # 2 - unblock PIN
  # 3 - change Admin PIN
  # 4 - set the Reset Code
  # Q - quit
  # Your selection?
  1
#+end_src

Enter 1 at the prompt for the passwd command, and enter 123456 at the first PIN prompt (the default user PIN is 123456).
Next, enter the new user PIN (prompted twice). Do not use a number — instead use a simple passphrase (like "horse apple garden") that’s at least 6 characters long and easy to type (required several times a day). Make sure it’s different than any other PIN or passphrase ever used before.

#+begin_src shell
  Your selection? 1
  # PIN changed.
  # 1 - change PIN
  # 2 - unblock PIN
  # 3 - change Admin PIN
  # 4 - set the Reset Code
  # Q - quit
  # Your selection?
#+end_src

Next, enter 3 to set the admin PIN, and enter 12345678 at the first PIN prompt (the default admin PIN is 12345678).
Next, enter the new admin PIN (prompted twice). Like with the user PIN above, do not use a number — instead use a simple passphrase at least 8 characters long. It doesn’t need to be any stronger than the user PIN, just different (enough so that an adversary wouldn’t be able to guess the admin PIN if she finds out your user PIN).

#+begin_src shell
  Your selection? 3
  # PIN changed.

  # 1 - change PIN
  # 2 - unblock PIN
  # 3 - change Admin PIN
  # 4 - set the Reset Code
  # Q - quit

  Your selection? q
#+end_src

Backup the PIN codes (see [[#Backup-PINS-and-PUKS-and-Lock-Code][Backup PINS]])

*** (optional) Transfer GPG sub-keys to YubiKey
Assuming you have generated the necessary GPG key-chain using the [[https://github.com/user/pure-security/blob/main/scripts/gpg-provision.py][gpg-provision.py]] script, the gpg key-chain is stored in the ~/tmp/gpg_xxxxx~ folder.
To instruct the GnuPG utility where the gpg-keychain is stored, execute the following pointing to the correct folder:

#+begin_src shell
  export GNUPGHOME=/tmp/gpg_xxxxx
#+end_src

From here use the GnuPG utility to edit the key, select the key, and send to card:

#+begin_src shell
  [user@archlinux ~]$ gpg --edit-key user
  # Secret key is available.

*** (optional) Create GPG sub-keys in YubiKey
As an alternative to creating GPG keys with the GnuPG utility, the GPG keys can be created directly on the YubiKey device. This is the safest method of creating GPG keys, as the key never leaves the device itself. Note however, that the YubiKey generated GPG keys can not be backed up. In other words, when the YubiKey is lost or compromised, all access to services is compromised as well.

Use the key-attr command so that when you generate your keys, it will generate Curve 25519 keys instead of RSA keys:

#+begin_src shell
  gpg --edit-card
  gpg/card> admin
  gpg/card> key-attr
  # Changing card key attribute for: Signature key
  # Please select what kind of key you want:
  #    (1) RSA
  #    (2) ECC
  # Your selection?
#+end_src

Select the ECC option:

#+begin_src shell
  Your selection? 2
  # Please select which elliptic curve you want:
  #    (1) Curve 25519
  #    (4) NIST P-384
  # Your selection?
#+end_src

Select Curve 25519:

#+begin_src shell
  # Your selection? 1
  # The card will now be re-configured to generate a key of type: ed25519
  # Note: There is no guarantee that the card supports the requested size.
  #       If the key generation does not succeed, please check the
  #       documentation of your card to see what sizes are allowed.
#+end_src

Enter the admin PIN when prompted to save your changes for that key. Select the same options (ECC and Curve 25519) as the prompts continue for the encryption key and authentication key:

#+begin_src shell
  # Changing card key attribute for: Encryption key
  # Please select what kind of key you want:
  #    (1) RSA
  #    (2) ECC
  Your selection? 2
  # Please select which elliptic curve you want:
  #    (1) Curve 25519
  #    (4) NIST P-384

  Your selection? 1
  # The card will now be re-configured to generate a key of type: ed25519
  # gpg/card>
#+end_src

Next, generate a new set of OpenPGP keys on the YubiKey, using the generate command:

#+begin_src shell
  gpg/card> generate
  # Make off-card backup of encryption key? (Y/n)
#+end_src

Enter n to ensure that the private keys never leave the YubiKey, and enter the admin PIN when prompted:

#+begin_src shell
  Make off-card backup of encryption key? (Y/n) n

  # Please note that the factory settings of the PINs are
  #    PIN = '123456'     Admin PIN = '12345678'
  # You should change them using the command --change-pin

  # Please specify how long the key should be valid.
  #          0 = key does not expire
  #       <n>  = key expires in n days
  #       <n>w = key expires in n weeks
  #       <n>m = key expires in n months
  #       <n>y = key expires in n years
  # Key is valid for? (0)
#+end_src

Then enter 0 to prevent the keys from expiring:

#+begin_src shell
  Key is valid for? (0) 0
  # Key does not expire at all
  Is this correct? (y/N) y

  # GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

  # Real name:
#+end_src

When prompted for real name, email address, and comment, use the “real name” field for the display name or alias associated with the OpenPGP key, the “email address” field for the email account associated with the key, and the “comment” field for a word or phrase that will distinguish this key from other keys. For example, I might enter the following for real name, email address, and comment:

#+begin_src shell
  Real name: user
  Email address: user@email.com
  Comment: YubiKey1
  #You selected this USER-ID:
    "user (YubiKey1) <user@email.com>"

  Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
#+end_src

Enter the admin PIN, and then the user PIN. The ID of the newly generated master key will be printed:

#+begin_src shell
  # gpg: key 0xABCDEF1234567890 marked as ultimately trusted
  # gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/home/user/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678.rev'

*** Test GPG Encryption
To test the functionality of encryption and decryption test the YubKey with the pass functionality:

#+begin_src shell
  [user@archlinux ~]$ pass generate test 32
  # The generated password for test is:
  # a=l~65v1d#c"L)O%99_zEotE4YY60Pm=
  [user@archlinux ~]$ pass test
  # a=l~65v1d#c"L)O%99_zEotE4YY60Pm=
#+end_src

** Configure YubiKey on another machine
Assuming that no existing GPG keys exist on the machine, follow to following steps to setup GnuPG to use an existing (configured) YubiKey on a new computer.
*** Import public key
**** Import public key from github
Assuming at some stage you have configured github with your public key for signing your commits, you can use the following command to import your public key from github:

#+begin_src shell
  [user@archlinux ~]$ curl https://github.com/user.gpg | gpg --import
  # gpg: keybox '/home/user/test/pubring.kbx' created
  #   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
  #                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  # 100  1273  100  1273    0     0   2295      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  2301
  # gpg: /home/user/test/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
  # gpg: key C8A9786CD87AEECB: public key "user <user@outlook.com>" imported
  # gpg: Total number processed: 1
  # gpg:               imported: 1
#+end_src
*** Create stub for YubIkey
Once the public key has been imported, the gpg stubs can be created with the following command:

#+begin_src shell
  [user@t570 ~]$ gpg --card-status
  # Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
